       "('The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of teriparatide administration on fracture healing after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients (26 cases) with atypical femoral fracture who were treated using intramedullary nailing between January 2009 and December 2013. Teriparatide was not administered to 15 patients (non-injection group) and was administered to 11 patients after surgery (injection group). Clinical results were assessed using the Nakajima score and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiographic results were compared for the time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union between the groups. Results: Time to recover walking ability and to decrease pain in the surgery region (VAS≤2) were significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. The time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union was significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. There were 5 cases of delayed bone union (33.3%) and 1 case of none union (6.7%) in the non-injection group and all cases obtained bone union in injection group. Conclusion: The injection group showed better clinical and radiographic results than the non-injection group after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fracture. Therefore, we think that teriparatide administration after intramedullary nailing could be a useful treatment option to promote bone union.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Although development of the adult Drosophila compound eye is very well understood, little is known about development of photoreceptors (PRs) in the simple larval eye. We show here that the larval eye is composed of 12 PRs, four of which express blue-sensitive rhodopsin5 (rh5) while the other eight contain green-sensitive rh6. This is similar to the 30:70 ratio of adult blue and green R8 cells. However, the stochastic choice of adult color PRs and the bistable loop of the warts and melted tumor suppressor genes that unambiguously specify rh5 and rh6 in R8 PRs are not involved in specification of larval PRs. Instead, primary PR precursors signal via EGFR to surrounding tissue to develop as secondary precursors, which will become Rh6-expressing PRs. EGFR signaling is required for the survival of the Rh6 subtype. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 subtype. Furthermore, the combinatorial action of the transcription factors Spalt, Seven-up, and Orthodenticle specifies the two PR subtypes. Therefore, even though the larval PRs and adult R8 PRs express the same rhodopsins (rh5 and rh6), they use very distinct mechanisms for their specification.',\n",

Development of larval PR precursor cells proceeds in a two-step process. First, primary precursors (also called BO founder cells) are specified; they express and require the proneural gene atonal (ato) and the retinal patterning genes sine oculis (so) and eyes absent (eya) as well as hedgehog (hh) signaling (Schmucker et al. 1994; Suzuki and Saigo 2000) . Then, primary precursors signal to the surrounding tissue by expressing the TGF␣ homolog spitz (spi), which activates EGF receptor (EGFR) and recruits adjacent cells to develop as secondary precursors (Daniel et al. 1999; Suzuki and Saigo 2000) . tailless (tll), which encodes an orphan nuclear receptor, opposes EGFR signaling in the surrounding optic lobe primordium, preventing adjacent cells from developing as PRs (Daniel et al. 1999) . Subsequently, as immature PRs detach from the optic lobe primordium and start to differentiate, they extend their axons and remain in contact with the optic lobe (Schmucker et al. 1992 (Schmucker et al. , 1997 Dumstrei et al. 2002) . Two distinct PR subtypes can be distinguished in the larval eye: Four PRs contain blue-sensitive Rh5 while eight contain green-sensitive Rh6. This is strongly reminiscent of adult R8 PRs, which express Rh5 in 30% of ommatidia and Rh6 in the remaining 70%. Thus, similar molecular mechanisms could act to specify the two distinct subtypes in larval PRs and in adult R8 cells.',\n",

The combinatorial action of transcription factors Seven-up (Svp), Sal, and Otd is required to distinguish the two subtypes. The Rh5 subtype requires sal and otd, while the Rh6 subtype requires seven-up (svp). EGFR signaling, otd, svp, and sal are also core components of PR development in the adult retina.

Larval PRs develop from a group of cells located at the ventral tip of the optic placode, adjacent to the progenitors of the optic lobe primordium (Green et al. 1993) . The earliest precursor cells express the proneural gene ato in a highly dynamic manner during embryonic stages 10-12 ( Fig. 1A ; Daniel et al. 1999; Suzuki and Saigo 2000) (we obtained comparable results using either the ato-Gal4 driver or an anti-Ato antibody; data not shown). Expression of ato in PR precursors decreases during stage 12 until no expression is found after embryonic stage 13. During embryonic stage 12, BO precursors start to express the neuronal marker Elav as well as Krüppel (Kr) and Fasciclin II (FasII) (Schmucker et al. 1992; Daniel et al. 1999) , which were used as molecular markers for immature PRs throughout embryogenesis (Figs. 1B, 3A, below). During optic lobe invagination, larval PRs remain connected with the optic lobe primordium by the Bolwig Nerve (BN), which extends while the distance between the PRs and optic lobe primordium gradually increases (Schmucker et al. 1992) . By stage 15, all PRs are largely separated from the optic lobe primordium and BO is positioned at the anterior part of the embryonic head (Fig. 1B) , where it becomes associated with the head skeleton at embryonic stage 17 (Green et al. 1993) .',\n",

Therefore, we tested whether wts and melt, which form a bistable loop of regulation required for the robust specification of Rh5 or Rh6 fate in adult R8, are also required in larval PRs. However we could not detect expression of wts or melt at any time during embryogenesis, as visualized using wts and melt enhancer trap lines. We also could not detect early maternal expression in embryos (data not shown). To test whether wts and melt are required for the subtype specification in the larval eye, we analyzed Rh5 and Rh6 expression in wts and melt mutant larvae. However, the expression of neither Rh5 nor Rh6 is affected ( Fig. 2A,B) . To manipulate the early phase of PR precursor specification and development, we made use of a sine oculis-Gal4 (so-Gal4), which starts to be expressed in the optic lobe placode at embryonic stage 10 and remains expressed in the optic lobe and all larval PRs throughout embryogenesis and larval life (Supplementary Fig. 1A,C) . Interestingly, the ectopic expression of UAS-wts or UAS-melt under the control of so-Gal4 did also not affect the expression Rh5 and Rh6 (Fig. 2C,D) . Furthermore the total number of larval PRs and the ratio of Rh5 PRs versus Rh6 PRs remain unaltered in both wts and melt gain of function (GOF) as well as in loss of function (LOF) (Fig. 2E) .

Primary BO precursors produce Spi, which is required in neighboring cells to develop as secondary precursors. In embryos mutant for spi, the immature larval eye only consists of three or four cells (Daniel et al. 1999 ). Therefore, we tested whether EGFR signaling is involved in the specification of larval PR subtypes and whether there is a correlation between primary precursors and rh5-expressing PRs or between secondary and rh6-expressing PRs. Because EGFR signaling has multiple earlier functions in the embryo, we misexpressed a dominant-negative form of EGFR (UAS-EGFR dn ) under the control of so-Gal4 to suppress EGFR activity in BO precursors. This results in the development of only three or four immature PRs as compared with ∼14 cells in the wild type (Fig. 3A,B) , a phenocopy of the BO in spi mutants (Daniel et al. 1999 ). All of the remaining three or four PRs all express Rh5 (Fig. 3D) as well as the general markers Elav, FasII, Kr, and Chp (Fig. 3B,F) . They also express the Rh5-subtypespecific marker sal (Fig. 3F, see below) , but not the Rh6-subtype-specific marker svp (see below).

No expression of Rh5 can be detected in sal mutants, even though the correct Cold (Fig. 6C) .

Since rh1, rh3, and rh4 expression cannot be detected, these four PRs appear to be \"empty\" and devoid of PR molecules (data not shown). PRs of the larval eye project into the region of the dendritic arborizations of the larval pacemaker neurons. Axon termini of Rh5 and Rh6 PRs are generally directly adjacent to each other (Mazzoni et al. 2005) . In sal mutants, all larval PRs project into the correct target region of the late embryonic brain (Fig. 6G) . We compared the projection termini of empty PRs with those of Rh6 PRs (\"empty\" PR termini are identified by FasII staining and the absence of Rh6 staining). At embryonic stage 17 (just before these mutants die), axonal termini of \"empty\" PRs project correctly to the target region, adjacent to Rh6 termini (Fig.  6H,I ). Therefore sal is essential in the larval eye for the proper differentiation of the Rh5 PRs but not for their early specification or for axonal targeting.',\n",

In the larval eye, svp is exclusively expressed in Rh6 PRs prior to rh6 expression, suggesting that it might be involved in the development of this subtype. We analyzed the expression of Rh5 and Rh6 in svp mutant embryos at stage 17 (as for sal, svp mutants die at the end of embryogenesis). While the total number of PRs (as marked by Elav, FasII, Kr, and Chp) remains unchanged (Fig. 6B,E) in svp mutants, all PRs express Rh5 (Fig. 6B ) and no Rh6 expression is detectable. Therefore, Rh6 cells appear to have switched fate toward the Rh5 fate. Consistent with the transformation of PRs into Rh5 subtype, all PRs express sal in svp mutants (Fig. 6E ). This suggests that svp is necessary for the repression of sal in the Rh6 subtype, thus allowing expression of rh6. To test whether svp is sufficient for the Rh6 PR fate, we performed gain-offunction experiments using early (so-Gal4) or later sevenless-Gal4 (sev-Gal4) drivers. The sev-Gal4 driver starts to be expressed in all larval PRs during late embryonic stages 12/13, just after all immature PRs have formed. It remains expressed through larval life ( Supplementary  Fig. 1B,D; data not shown). In larvae that express UASsvp under the control of so-Gal4, no Rh5 expression can be detected, while all BO PRs express rh6 with no change in the overall number of PRs (Fig. 6F) . However, if sal expression is affected, it is not completely abolished, with one to three PRs still weakly expressing Sal (data not shown), arguing that Rh6 is now expressed in the Rh5 subtype. Later expression of UAS-svp under the control of sev-Gal4 does not result in alteration of Rh expression (data not shown). Thus, svp not only acts to repress sal in the Rh6 subtype, but it also acts as an activator of Rh6 expression since Sal and Rh6 can coexist in the same cell. In contrast ectopic expression of UASsalm under the control of so-Gal4 or of sev-Gal4 leads to no change of Rh5 or Rh6 expression. Expression of Svp remains unaffected, with about eight cells still expressing Svp (data not shown). Thus svp is necessary and sufficient to induce the Rh6 fate. In contrast sal is necessary but not sufficient for the Rh5 fate.',\n",

In the adult retina, otd is expressed in all PRs. Similarly, otd is expressed in all embryonic immature PRs, and this expression is maintained during larval life. During early development, otd acts as a major component for patterning the anterior region of the embryo (Cohen and Jurgens 1990) . During stages 8/9, otd expression spans the entire cephalic region (Fig. 7A) and becomes subsequently restricted to more anterior regions and regions giving rise to the brain. However otd expression is excluded from large parts of the optic lobe primordium as well as from the region giving rise to larval PRs (Fig. 7B) . Starting at stage 12, however, otd expression is reinitiated in the ventral lateral part of the optic lobe primordium, the region that will give rise to the precursors of larval PRs. otd remains expressed in all PRs throughout embryogenesis and larval life (Fig. 7C-F) . otd is not required for the formation of larval PRs (nor the larval optic lobe primordium): Even though otd-null mutant embryos show severe head involution defects, the normal number of immature PRs is formed (data not shown). To investigate whether otd is involved in larval PR-subtype specification, we analyzed Rh5 and Rh6 expression in viable otd uvi mutants ( Vandendries et al. 1996) . In otd uvi , larval PRs do not express Rh5 while the total number of PRs remains the same (Fig. 7G,H ) and all PRs express Rh6 (Fig. 7G) . About four cells still express sal, but these cells now express Rh6 instead of Rh5 (Fig. 7H) . Interestingly, the number of Svp-expressing cells is not altered, with four Svp-negative PRs expressing Rh6 (data not shown). This indicates that, in the Rh5 subtype, otd acts as an inhibitor of rh6 expression and is required for Rh5 expression. As expression of otd is unaltered in sal mutants (data not shown), otd, like sal, seems to be necessary but not sufficient for Rh5 expression. otd and sal expression does not depend on each other, and since they are both required for Rh5 expression, they appear to act in parallel pathways.',\n",

       "   'text': 'What is the function of the EGFR pathway in antagonizing tll function? The Ets transcription factors yan and pnt are both expressed during the period of secondary precursor specification. In response to EGFR signaling, Yan acts as a repressor and Pnt as an activator. Their tightly controlled activation, cross-regulation, and competition for binding sites are essential for appropriate EGFR signaling. It is difficult, however, to test their function in BO PR formation, as mutants die with strong patterning defects in the embryo. We could test the function of EGFR because we were able to inhibit its function late, specifically in the optic lobe region, by misexpressing a dominant-negative form of EGFR. This likely inhibits but might not completely abolish endogenous EGFR signaling. Thus, even though concomitantly preventing cell death and EGFR signaling restores Rh6 PRs, it is possible that basal levels of EGFR signaling are sufficient for the specification of Rh6 PR specification, but not for survival. The mechanism by which tll affects secondary precursor development remains elusive. tll might prevent cells from developing as secondary precursors, leading them to undergo apoptosis. Only cells that receive enough EGFR signal near primary PR precursors are rescued. Alternatively a second signal could make tll-expressing cells undergo apoptosis. Notch and hedgehog signaling have also been shown to be involved the development of larval PRs and may provide an alternative source for proper subtype specification and tll acts in the surrounding tissue to inhibit secondary precursor development. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 PR subtype, whereas secondary precursors give rise to the Rh6 PR subtype. In the Rh5 PR subtype, sal and otd are required for Rh5 expression, and otd further for the repression of Rh6. In the Rh6 subtype, svp is required for Rh6 expression and for the repression of sal expression. (B) The negative feedback loop of wts and melt mediates the decision of R8 to express Rh6 or Rh5. Which way the loop swings depends on an instructive signal of the overlying R7 cell. The presence of gene expression is indicated by black type and its absence is indicated with gray type. Arrows shown in black (for activation) and red (for repression) indicate an active interaction; gray arrows indicate the absence of this interaction.',\n",

In contrast, svp is required and sufficient for the Rh6 subtype where it represses the Rh5-subtype fate.

Most strikingly, the two Rhs expressed in the larval eye are R8 Rhs. The type of Rh expressed in R8 is instructed by R7 and maintained by the wts/melt bistable loop (Fig. 8B) . In contrast, in the larva, there are no additional PRs in BO to instruct the Rh5 and Rh6 PR fate and the expression of these genes does not depend on wts and melt. Since misexpression of wts or melt does not affect larval PRs, the downstream effectors of the loop must be absent or not functioning in the larval eye. Rh5 PRs, which are specified first, might be a source of an instructive signal for the Rh6-subtype fate. Alternatively, this signal might arise from non-BO cells. However, we have not yet been able to determine its identity. Finally, larval PRs are not specified or distributed stochastically in BO, as the two groups that express Rhr or Rh6 are physically distinct, presumably explaining why there is not need for the bistable loop of wts and melt.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients (26 cases) with atypical femoral fracture who were treated using intramedullary nailing between January 2009 and December 2013. Teriparatide was not administered to 15 patients (non-injection group) and was administered to 11 patients after surgery (injection group). Clinical results were assessed using the Nakajima score and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiographic results were compared for the time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union between the groups. Results: Time to recover walking ability and to decrease pain in the surgery region (VAS≤2) were significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. The time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union was significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. There were 5 cases of delayed bone union (33.3%) and 1 case of none union (6.7%) in the non-injection group and all cases obtained bone union in injection group. Conclusion: The injection group showed better clinical and radiographic results than the non-injection group after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fracture. Therefore, we think that teriparatide administration after intramedullary nailing could be a useful treatment option to promote bone union.',\n",

In this study, a series of PGMA-based supramolecular polycations (PGED-Gd@PGEAs) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functions were readily constructed by assembling multiple adamantine-headed star PGEA (Ad-PGEA) units with a versatile PGED-CD-Gd backbone, which possessed numerous flanking β-cyclodextrin species and Gd 3+ ions. The properties of different PGED-Gd@PGEA vectors were systematically characterized, including the plasmid DNA condensation ability, cytotoxicity, gene transfection efficiency, cellular uptake and MRI function. Such supramolecular gene vectors had lower toxicity than 'gold standard' polyethylenimine (PEI, 25 kDa). Furthermore, PGED-Gd@PGEAs exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiencies than PEI or the constituent units (PGED-CD-Gd and Ad-PGEA). The chelation of Gd 3+ ions imparted the PGED-Gd@PGEA vectors with a good MRI ability without obvious adverse effects. The present design of PGMA-based supramolecular polycations with Gd 3+ chelation would provide useful information for the development of low-toxicity and high-efficiency multifunctional gene delivery systems.\",\n",

We show here that the larval eye is composed of 12 PRs, four of which express blue-sensitive rhodopsin5 (rh5) while the other eight contain green-sensitive rh6. This is similar to the 30:70 ratio of adult blue and green R8 cells. However, the stochastic choice of adult color PRs and the bistable loop of the warts and melted tumor suppressor genes that unambiguously specify rh5 and rh6 in R8 PRs are not involved in specification of larval PRs. Instead, primary PR precursors signal via EGFR to surrounding tissue to develop as secondary precursors, which will become Rh6-expressing PRs. EGFR signaling is required for the survival of the Rh6 subtype. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 subtype. Furthermore, the combinatorial action of the transcription factors Spalt, Seven-up, and Orthodenticle specifies the two PR subtypes. Therefore, even though the larval PRs and adult R8 PRs express the same rhodopsins (rh5 and rh6), they use very distinct mechanisms for their specification.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Abstract The formalism of Quantum Mechanics is based by definition on conserving probabilities and thus there is no room for the description of dissipative systems in Quantum Mechanics. The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the arrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In Quantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible evolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In this paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The irreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalent representations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependent SU(1,1) coherent states. The exact action for the dho is derived in the path integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, the rôle of dissipation in the quantum model of the brain and the occurrence that the cosmological arrow of time, the thermodynamical one and the biological one point into the same direction are shortly mentioned.',\n",

Materials and Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (years 2003-2014) in adult hospitalizations for AIS to determine the outcomes and complications associated with LDs, using ICD-9-CM codes. In 2014, we also aimed to estimate adjusted odds of AIS in patients with LDs compared to patients without LDs. The multivariable survey logistic regression models, weighted to account for sampling strategy, were fitted to evaluate relationship of LDs with AIS among 2014 hospitalizations, and outcomes and complications amongst AIS patients from 2003 -2014 . Results and Conclusions: In 2014, there were 28,212,820 (2.02% AIS and 5.50% LDs) hospitalizations. LDs patients had higher prevalence and odds of having AIS compared with non-LDs.

The mixed endothelin-1 ET A /ET B receptor antagonist bosentan but not the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan completely inhibited the pressure overload-induced increase in left ventricular BNP GATA4 binding activity. Bosentan alone had no statistically significant effect on GATA4 binding activity of the left ventricle in conscious animals.

However, considerable numbers of cancer cells, especially some highly malignant tumors, are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL, and some cancer cells that were originally sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can become resistant after repeated exposure (acquired resistance). Understanding the mechanisms underlying such resistance and developing strategies to overcome it are important for the successful use of TRAIL for cancer therapy. Resistance to TRAIL can occur at different points in the signaling pathways of TRAILinduced apoptosis. Dysfunctions of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 due to mutations can lead to resistance. The adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 are essential for assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex, and defects in either of these molecules can lead to TRAIL resistance. Overexpression of cellular FADD-like interleukin-1b-converting enzymeinhibitory protein (cFLIP) correlates with TRAIL resistance in several types of cancer. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X L , loss of Bax or Bak function, high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and reduced release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac/Diablo) from the mitochondria to the cytosol have all been reported to result in TRAIL resistance in mitochondriadependent type II cancer cells. Finally, activation of different subunits of mitogen-activated protein kinases or nuclear factor-kappa B can lead to development of either TRAIL resistance or apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells.',\n",

The HOG pathway is rapidly activated under conditions of elevated osmolarity and regulates transcriptional and metabolic changes within the cell. Under normal growth conditions, however, a three-component phospho-relay consisting of the histidine kinase Sln1, the transfer protein Ypd1, and the response regulator Ssk1 represses HOG pathway activity by phosphorylation of Ssk1. This inhibition of the HOG pathway is essential for cellular fitness in normal osmolarity. Nevertheless, the extent to and mechanisms by which inhibition is robust to fluctuations in the concentrations of the phospho-relay components has received little attention. Results: We established that the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1 phospho-relay is robust-it is able to maintain inhibition of the HOG pathway even after significant changes in the levels of its three components. We then developed a biochemically realistic mathematical model of the phospho-relay, which suggested that robustness is due to buffering by a large excess pool of Ypd1. We confirmed experimentally that depletion of the Ypd1 pool results in inappropriate activation of the HOG pathway. Conclusions: We identified buffering by an intermediate component in excess as a novel mechanism through which a phospho-relay can achieve robustness. This buffering requires multiple components and is therefore unavailable to two-component systems, suggesting one important advantage of multi-component relays.',\n",

Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in an OFDM system. In this paper, we formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem, which takes advantage of the sparsity of the channel impulse response and reduces the number of probing measurements, which in turn reduces the ADC speed needed for channel estimation. Specifically, we propose sending out pilots with random phases in order to \"spread out\" the sparse taps in the impulse response over the uniformly downsampled measurements at the low speed receiver ADC, so that the impulse response can still be recovered by sparse optimization. This contribution leads to high resolution channel estimation with low speed ADCs, distinguishing this paper from the existing attempts of OFDM channel estimation. We also propose a novel estimator that performs better than the commonly used 1 minimization. Specifically, it significantly reduces estimation error by combing 1 minimization with iterative support detection and limited-support least-squares. While letting the receiver ADC running at a speed as low as 1/16 of the speed of the transmitter DAC, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different measurement SNRs. The proposed system has channel estimation resolution as high as the system equipped with the high speed ADCs, and the proposed algorithm provides additional 6 dB gain for signal to noise ratio.',\n",

The Laplacian pyramid is a multi-resolution image representation that captures the loss of information occurring through repeated reduction of the spatial resolution. The generation of this data structure involves the use of two complementary functions: EXPAND, which increases the size of an image by a factor of 2, and REDUCE, which performs the reverse operation. The first modification is the adjunction of a pre-filter to the initial EXPAND function in order to guarantee an image extrapolation that is an exact interpolation of the coarser resolution level. The second refinement is a REDUCE operation modified to minimize information loss. The corresponding least squares Laplacian pyramid (LSLP) is generated by adding a post-filter to the initial REDUCE function. These new functions have an efficient implementation using recursive algorithms. Preliminary experiments indicate improved performance: for a Gaussian-like kernel (a = 3), the new EXPAND function exhibits a 2 to 2.5 dB attenuation of the first level of the Laplacian pyramid, while the complete scheme (LSLP) leads to a 4.7 to 8.5 dB improvement in the two images used to test the procedure. For comparable compression ratios, the subjective image quality for the LSLP appears to be significantly better. A theoretical relationship between the present approach and the family of quadrature mirror filter image pyramids is also derived.\",\n",

Linkers of 11 residues or more were required for biological activity. Equilibrium stability varied substantially with linker length, reaching a maximum for glycine-rich linkers containing 19 residues. The effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics. By fixing the linker length at 19 residues and varying the ratio of Ala͞Gly or Ser͞Gly in a 16-residue-randomized region, the effects of linker f lexibility were examined.

Enforcing the proper optically-thin limit for the radiative line-acceleration is found to decrease both the mass-loss and wind acceleration, while rotation boosts both properties. We define optically-thin-correction and rotation parameters to quantify these effects on the global mass-loss rate and develop scaling laws for the surface massflux as a function of surface colatitude. These scaling laws are found to agree with previous laws derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetospheres. The dipole magnetosphere velocity structure is found to differ from a global beta-velocity law, which contradicts a central assumption of the previously-developed XADM model of X-ray emission from magnetospheres.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The equilibrium binding energy is an important factor in the design of materials and devices. However, it presents great computational challenges for materials built up from nanostructures. Here we investigate the binding-energy scaling law from first-principles calculations. We show that the equilibrium binding energy per atom between identical nanostructures can scale up or down with nanostructure size. From the energy scaling law, we predict finite large-size limits of binding energy per atom. We find that there are two competing factors in the determination of the binding energy: Nonadditivities of van der Waals coefficients and center-to-center distance between nanostructures. To uncode the detail, the nonadditivity of the static multipole polarizability is investigated. We find that the higher-order multipole polarizability displays ultra-strong intrinsic nonadditivity, no matter if the dipole polarizability is additive or not.',\n",

       " {'text': 'We determine the commutation relations satisfied by the quantized electromagnetic field in the presence of macroscopic dielectrics and conductors, with arbitrary dispersive and dissipative properties. We consider in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty gap, and we show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs, including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary conditions to reproduce the correct form of the commutation relations near the surfaces of the conductors, suggests that caution should be used when these idealized boundary conditions are used in investigations of proximity phenomena originating from the quantized electromagnetic field, like the Casimir effect.',\n",

The well-known transition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the emergence of \"super-hubs\" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the nonextensive Kaniadakis κ-distribution. Through numerical simulation and mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the nonextensive parameter κ.',\n",

In this paper, we describe a new method to detect and remove cosmic rays in multi-fiber spectroscopic single exposures. Through the use of two-dimensional profile fitting and a noise model that considers the position-dependent errors, we successfully detect as many as 80% of the cosmic rays and correct the cosmic ray polluted pixels to an average accuracy of 97.8%. Multiple tests and comparisons with both simulated data and real LAMOST data show that the method works properly in detection rate, false detection rate, and validity of cosmic ray correction.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Abstract: The semi-constrained NMSSM (scNMSSM) extends the MSSM by a singlet field, and requires unification of the soft SUSY breaking terms in the squark and slepton sectors, while it allows that in the Higgs sector to be different. We try to interpret the muon g-2 in the scNMSSM, under the constraints of 125 GeV Higgs data, B physics, searches for low and high mass resonances, searches for SUSY particles at the LHC, dark matter relic density by WMAP/Planck, and direct searches for dark matter by LUX, XENON1T, and PandaX-II. We find that under the above constraints, the scNMSSM can still (i) satisfy muon g-2 at 1σ level, with a light muon sneutrino and light chargino; (ii) predict a highly-singlet-dominated 95 GeV Higgs, with a diphoton rate as hinted at by CMS data, because of a light higgsino-like chargino and moderate λ; (iii) get low fine tuning from the GUT scale with small µ eff , M0, M 1/2 , andA0, with a lighter stop mass which can be as low as about 500 GeV, which can be further checked in future studies with search results from the 13 TeV LHC; (iv) have the lightest neutralino be singlino-dominated or higgsino-dominated, while the bino and wino are heavier because of high gluino bounds at the LHC and universal gaugino conditions at the GUT scale; (v) satisfy all the above constraints, although it is not easy for the lightest neutralino, as the only dark matter candidate, to get enough relic density. Several ways to increase relic density are discussed.',\n",

According to the result of the variance analysis, the effects of the hormones and hormone doses on the examined characters were found significant as statistically.
