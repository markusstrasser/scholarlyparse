text,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of teriparatide administration on fracture healing after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients (26 cases) with atypical femoral fracture who were treated using intramedullary nailing between January 2009 and December 2013. Teriparatide was not administered to 15 patients (non-injection group) and was administered to 11 patients after surgery (injection group). Clinical results were assessed using the Nakajima score and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiographic results were compared for the time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union between the groups. Results: Time to recover walking ability and to decrease pain in the surgery region (VAS≤2) were significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. The time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union was significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. There were 5 cases of delayed bone union (33.3%) and 1 case of none union (6.7%) in the non-injection group and all cases obtained bone union in injection group. Conclusion: The injection group showed better clinical and radiographic results than the non-injection group after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fracture. Therefore, we think that teriparatide administration after intramedullary nailing could be a useful treatment option to promote bone union."
text,"Ethanolamine (EA) or ethylenediamine (ED)-functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA), namely PGEA or PGED, has recently been used as effective gene carriers because of their low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency. In this study, a series of PGMA-based supramolecular polycations (PGED-Gd@PGEAs) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functions were readily constructed by assembling multiple adamantine-headed star PGEA (Ad-PGEA) units with a versatile PGED-CD-Gd backbone, which possessed numerous flanking β-cyclodextrin species and Gd 3+ ions. The properties of different PGED-Gd@PGEA vectors were systematically characterized, including the plasmid DNA condensation ability, cytotoxicity, gene transfection efficiency, cellular uptake and MRI function. Such supramolecular gene vectors had lower toxicity than 'gold standard' polyethylenimine (PEI, 25 kDa). Furthermore, PGED-Gd@PGEAs exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiencies than PEI or the constituent units (PGED-CD-Gd and Ad-PGEA). The chelation of Gd 3+ ions imparted the PGED-Gd@PGEA vectors with a good MRI ability without obvious adverse effects. The present design of PGMA-based supramolecular polycations with Gd 3+ chelation would provide useful information for the development of low-toxicity and high-efficiency multifunctional gene delivery systems."

text,"This technical note studies Markov decision processes under parameter uncertainty. We adapt the distributionally robust optimization framework, assume that the uncertain parameters are random variables following an unknown distribution, and seek the strategy which maximizes the expected performance under the most adversarial distribution. In particular, we generalize a previous study [1] which concentrates on distribution sets with very special structure to a considerably more generic class of distribution sets, and show that the optimal strategy can be obtained efficiently under mild technical conditions. This significantly extends the applicability of distributionally robust MDPs by incorporating probabilistic information of uncertainty in a more flexible way."
text,"Although development of the adult Drosophila compound eye is very well understood, little is known about development of photoreceptors (PRs) in the simple larval eye. We show here that the larval eye is composed of 12 PRs, four of which express blue-sensitive rhodopsin5 (rh5) while the other eight contain green-sensitive rh6. This is similar to the 30:70 ratio of adult blue and green R8 cells. However, the stochastic choice of adult color PRs and the bistable loop of the warts and melted tumor suppressor genes that unambiguously specify rh5 and rh6 in R8 PRs are not involved in specification of larval PRs. Instead, primary PR precursors signal via EGFR to surrounding tissue to develop as secondary precursors, which will become Rh6-expressing PRs. EGFR signaling is required for the survival of the Rh6 subtype. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 subtype. Furthermore, the combinatorial action of the transcription factors Spalt, Seven-up, and Orthodenticle specifies the two PR subtypes. Therefore, even though the larval PRs and adult R8 PRs express the same rhodopsins (rh5 and rh6), they use very distinct mechanisms for their specification."

text,"Abstract. Recently a new graph convexity was introduced, arising from Steiner intervals in graphs that are a natural generalization of geodesic intervals. The Steiner tree of a set W on k vertices in a connected graph G is a tree with the smallest number of edges in G that contains all vertices of W . The Steiner interval I(W ) of W consists of all vertices in G that lie on some Steiner tree with respect to W . Moreover, a set S of vertices in a graph G is k-Steiner convex, denoted g k -convex, if the Steiner interval I(W ) of every set W on k vertices is contained in S. In this paper we consider two types of local convexities. In particular, for every k > 3, we characterize graphs with g k -convex closed neighborhoods around all vertices of the graph. Then we follow with a characterization of graphs with g 4 -convex closed neighborhoods around all g 4 -convex sets of the graph."

Continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) is a supplementary option for preventing the adverse events following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Regulation of the flow rate based on the color of drainage bag is significant to prevent the clot formation and retention, which is controlled manually at present. To achieve a better control of flow rate and reduce inappropriate flow rate-related adverse effects, we designed an automatic flow rate controller for CBI applied with wireless sensor and evaluated its clinical efficacy."

I will point out that a lack of cooperation from fellow academics may defeat our research purposes, and will survey some studies involving U.S., European, and Chinese academics as research participants to illustrate education researchers' efforts to work with fellow academics against the odds. By referencing my personal experience of engaging with Chinese academics, I will then discuss the role of personal contacts in research and reflect upon various constraints in accessing fellow academics as research participants. I will suggest that, when we do participate in a fellow researcher's project, the incentive is a desire to support our peers in the spirit of ""academic citizenship."""
text,"Abstract-This paper gives a comprehensive study on the modeling and design challenges of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in high speed three-dimensional (3D) system integration. To investigate the propagation characteristics incurred by operations within the ultra-broad band frequency range, we propose an equivalent circuit model which accounts for rough sidewall effect and high frequency effect. A closed-form expression for TSV metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitance in both depletion and accumulation regions is proposed. The coupling of TSV arrays and near and far field effect on crosstalk analysis are performed using 3D Electro-Magnetic (EM) field solver. Based on the TSV circuit model, we optimize the TSVs' architecture and manufacturing process parameters and develop effective design guidelines for TSVs, which could be used to resolve the signal integrity issues arising at high frequency data transmission in 3D Integrated Circuits (ICs)."

text,"Abstract Developing methods that result in targeting of therapeutic molecules in gene therapies to target tissues has importance, as targeting can increase efficacy and decrease off target-side-effects. Work from my laboratory previously showed that the extracellular matrix protein Del1 is organized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) via the Del1 deposition domain (DDD). In this work, a fusion protein with DDD was made to assay the ability to immobilize an enzyme without disrupting enzymatic function. A prostatic cancer-derived cell line LNCap that grows in an androgendependent manner was used with 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 aHD), which catalyzes dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Plasmids encoding a 3aHD:DDD fusion were generated and transfected into cultured cells. The effects of 3aHD immobilized in the ECM by the DDD were evaluated by monitoring growth of LNCap cells and DHT concentrations. It was demonstrated that the DDD could immobilize an enzyme in the ECM without interfering with function."

text,"We describe cloned segments of rDNA that contain short type I insertions of differing lengths. These insertions represent a coterminal subset of sequences from the right hand side of the major 5kb type I insertion. Three of these shorter insertions are flanked on both sides by a short sequence present as a single copy in uninterrupted rDNA units. The duplicated segment is 7, 14 and 15 nucleotides in the different clones. In this respect, the insertions differ from the 5kb type I insertion, where the corresponding sequence is found only at the right hand junction and where at the left hand side there is a deletion of 9 nucleotides of rDNA (Roiha et al. ,1981). One clone is unusual in that it contains two type I insertions, one of which is flanked by a 14 nucleotide repeat. The left hand junction of the second insertion occurs 380 nucleotides downstream in the rDNA unit from the first. It has an identical right hand junction to the other elements and the 380 nucleotide rDNA sequence is repeated on both sides of the insertion. We discuss the variety of sequence rearrangements of the rDNA which flank type I insertions."
text,"Abstract The formalism of Quantum Mechanics is based by definition on conserving probabilities and thus there is no room for the description of dissipative systems in Quantum Mechanics. The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the arrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In Quantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible evolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In this paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The irreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalent representations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependent SU(1,1) coherent states. The exact action for the dho is derived in the path integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, the rôle of dissipation in the quantum model of the brain and the occurrence that the cosmological arrow of time, the thermodynamical one and the biological one point into the same direction are shortly mentioned."

text,"Abstract. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of 4,587 (94% of the total) confirmed dengue cases in Kaohsiung and Fengshan Cities (a two-city area) that occurred in Taiwan from 2001 to 2003. The epidemic had two simultaneous distinct diffusion patterns. One was a contiguous pattern, mostly limited to 1 km from an initial cluster, reflecting that there was a rapid dispersal of infected Aedes aegypti and viremic persons. The second followed a relocation pattern, involving clusters of cases that diffused over 10 weeks starting from the southern and moving to the northern parts of the two-city area. The virus from one clustering site jumped to several distant areas where it rapidly dispersed through a series of human-mosquito transmission cycles to several localities. In both patterns, transmission of disease quickly enlarged the epidemic areas. Future dengue control efforts would benefit from a timely syndromic surveillance system plus extensive public education on how to avoid further transmission."

text,"Construction of genetic linkage map is essential for genetic and genomic studies. Recent advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies made it possible to generate high-density and high-resolution genetic linkage maps, especially for the organisms lacking extensive genomic resources. In the present work, we constructed a high-density and high-resolution genetic map for channel catfish with three large resource families genotyped using the catfish 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 54,342 SNPs were placed on the linkage map, which to our knowledge had the highest marker density among aquaculture species. The estimated genetic size was 3,505.4 cM with a resolution of 0.22 cM for sex-averaged genetic map. The sex-specific linkage maps spanned a total of 4,495.1 cM in females and 2,593.7 cM in males, presenting a ratio of 1.7 : 1 between female and male in recombination fraction. After integration with the previously established physical map, over 87% of physical map contigs were anchored to the linkage groups that covered a physical length of 867 Mb, accounting for ∼90% of the catfish genome. The integrated map provides a valuable tool for validating and improving the catfish whole-genome assembly and facilitates fine-scale QTL mapping and positional cloning of genes responsible for economically important traits."

text,"Background: Trust is a critical component of competency committees given their high-stakes decisions. Research from outside of medicine on group trust has not focused on trust in group decisions, and ""group trust"" has not been clearly defined. The purpose was twofold: to examine the definition of trust in the context of group decisions and to explore what factors may influence trust from the perspective of those who rely on competency committees through a proposed group trust model. Methods: The authors conducted a literature search of four online databases, seeking articles published on trust in group settings. Reviewers extracted, coded, and analyzed key data including definitions of trust and factors pertaining to group trust. Results: The authors selected 42 articles for full text review. Although reviewers found multiple general definitions of trust, they were unable to find a clear definition of group trust and propose the following: a group-directed willingness to accept vulnerability to actions of the members based on the expectation that members will perform a particular action important to the group, encompassing social exchange, collective perceptions, and interpersonal trust. Additionally, the authors propose a model encompassing individual level factors (trustor and trustee), interpersonal interactions, group level factors (structure and processes), and environmental factors."
text,"Abstract: Background and objectives: The Studies have suggested hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. However, few of the studies with a small number of patients had tested the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the outcomes and complications among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We hypothesized that lipid disorders (LDs), though risk factors for AIS, were associated with better outcomes and fewer post-stroke complications. Materials and Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (years 2003-2014) in adult hospitalizations for AIS to determine the outcomes and complications associated with LDs, using ICD-9-CM codes. In 2014, we also aimed to estimate adjusted odds of AIS in patients with LDs compared to patients without LDs. The multivariable survey logistic regression models, weighted to account for sampling strategy, were fitted to evaluate relationship of LDs with AIS among 2014 hospitalizations, and outcomes and complications amongst AIS patients from 2003 -2014 . Results and Conclusions: In 2014, there were 28,212,820 (2.02% AIS and 5.50% LDs) hospitalizations. LDs patients had higher prevalence and odds of having AIS compared with non-LDs. Between 2003-2014, of the total 4,224,924 AIS hospitalizations, 451,645 (10.69%) had LDs. Patients with LDs had lower percentages and odds of mortality, risk of death, major/extreme disability, discharge to nursing facility, and complications including epilepsy, stroke-associated pneumonia, GI-bleeding and hemorrhagic-transformation compared to non-LDs. Although LDs are risk factors for AIS, concurrent LDs in AIS is not only associated with lower mortality and disability but also lower post-stroke complications and higher chance of discharge to home."

text,"Pervasive computing systems employ distributed and embedded devices in order to raise, communicate, and process data in an anytime-anywhere fashion. Certainly, its most prominent device is the smartphone due to its wide proliferation, growing computation power, and wireless networking capabilities. In this context, we revisit the implementation of digitalized word-of-mouth that suggests exchanging item preferences between smartphones ofine and directly in immediate proximity. Collaboratively and decentrally collecting data in this way has two benefts. First, it allows to attach for instance location-sensitive context information in order to enrich collected item preferences. Second, model building does not require network connectivity. Despite the benefts, the approach naturally raises data privacy and data scarcity issues. In order to address both, we propose Propagate and Filter, a method that translates the traditional approach of fnding similar peers and exchanging item preferences among each other from the feld of decentralized to that of pervasive recommender systems. Additionally, we present preliminary results on a prototype mobile application that implements the proposed device-to-device information exchange. Average ad-hoc connection delays of 25.9 seconds and reliable connection success rates within 6 meters underpin the approach's technical feasibility."
text,"Estimating 3D human pose from monocular images demands large amounts of 3D pose and in-the-wild 2D pose annotated datasets which are costly and require sophisticated systems to acquire. In this regard, we propose a metric learning based approach to jointly learn a rich embedding and 3D pose regression from the embedding using multi-view synchronised videos of human motions and very limited 3D pose annotations. The inclusion of metric learning to the baseline pose estimation framework improves the performance by 21% when 3D supervision is limited. In addition, we make use of a person-identity based adversarial loss as additional weak supervision to outperform state-of-the-art whilst using a much smaller network. Lastly, but importantly, we demonstrate the advantages of the learned embedding and establish view-invariant pose retrieval benchmarks on two popular, publicly available multi-view human pose datasets, Human 3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, to facilitate future research."

text,"System calibration is fundamental to the overall accuracy of the ultrasonic temperature measurement, and it is basically involved in accurately measuring the path length and the system latency of the ultrasonic system. This paper proposes a method of high accuracy system calibration. By estimating the time delay between the transmitted signal and the received signal at several different temperatures, the calibration equations are constructed, and the calibrated results are determined with the use of the least squares algorithm. The formulas are deduced for calculating the calibration uncertainties, and the possible influential factors are analyzed. The experimental results in distilled water show that the calibrated path length and system latency can achieve uncertainties of 0.058 mm and 0.038 μs, respectively, and the temperature accuracy is significantly improved by using the calibrated results. The temperature error remains within ±0.04˚C consistently, and the percentage error is less than 0.15%."
text,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a ubiquitous problem that affects public health and safety. A test that can reliably identify individuals that suffer from EDS is needed. In contrast to other methods, salivary biomarkers are an objective, inexpensive, and noninvasive method to identify individuals with inadequate sleep. Although we have previously shown that inflammatory genes are elevated in saliva samples taken from sleep deprived individuals, it is unclear if inflammatory genes will be elevated in clinical populations with EDS. In this study, salivary samples from individuals with sleep apnea were evaluated using the Taqman low density inflammation array. Transcript levels for 3 genes, including prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), were elevated in patients with sleep apnea. Interestingly, PTGS2 was also elevated in patients with EDS but who did not have sleep apnea. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using salivary transcript levels to identify individuals that self-report excessive daytime sleepiness."
text,"Background-The signaling cascades responsible for the activation of transcription factors in the hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes during hemodynamic overload are largely unknown. Several of the genes upregulated in the hypertrophied heart, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene, are controlled by the cardiac-restricted zinc finger transcription factor GATA4. Methods and Results-An in vivo model of intravenous administration of arginine 8 -vasopressin (AVP) for up to 4 hours in conscious normotensive rats was used to study the signaling mechanisms for GATA activation in response to pressure overload. Gel mobility shift assays were used to analyze the trans-acting factors that interact with the GATA motifs of the BNP promoter. AVP-induced increase in mean arterial pressure was followed by a significant increase in the BNP and c-fos mRNA levels in both the endocardial and epicardial layers of the left ventricle, whereas GATA4 and GATA6 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Pressure overload within 15 to 60 minutes produced an increase in left ventricular BNP GATA4 but not GATA5 and GATA6 binding activity, and at 30 minutes a 2.2-fold increase (PϽ0.001) in GATA4 binding was noted. The mixed endothelin-1 ET A /ET B receptor antagonist bosentan but not the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan completely inhibited the pressure overload-induced increase in left ventricular BNP GATA4 binding activity. Bosentan alone had no statistically significant effect on GATA4 binding activity of the left ventricle in conscious animals. Conclusions-ET-1 is a signaling molecule that rapidly upregulates GATA4 DNA binding activity in response to pressure overload in vivo. (Circulation. 2001;103:730-735.) "

It found that the Bosch DC microgrid uses generated PV energy 6%-8% more efficiently than traditional AC systems."
text,"A photosynthetic organism is subjected to photooxidative stress when more light energy is absorbed than is used in photosynthesis. In the light, highly reactive singlet oxygen can be produced via triplet chlorophyll formation in the reaction centre of photosystem II and in the antenna system. In the antenna, triplet chlorophyll is produced directly by excited singlet chlorophyll, while in the reaction centre it is formed via charge recombination of the light-induced charge pair. Changes of the mid-point potential of the primary quinone acceptor in photosystem II modulate the pathway of charge recombination in photosystem II and influence the yield of singlet oxygen production. Singlet oxygen can be quenched by b-carotene, a-tocopherol or can react with the D1 protein of photosystem II as target. If not completely quenched, it can specifically trigger the up-regulation of the expression of genes which are involved in the molecular defence response of plants against photo-oxidative stress."
text,"The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is regarded as a potential anticancer agent. However, considerable numbers of cancer cells, especially some highly malignant tumors, are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL, and some cancer cells that were originally sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can become resistant after repeated exposure (acquired resistance). Understanding the mechanisms underlying such resistance and developing strategies to overcome it are important for the successful use of TRAIL for cancer therapy. Resistance to TRAIL can occur at different points in the signaling pathways of TRAILinduced apoptosis. Dysfunctions of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 due to mutations can lead to resistance. The adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 are essential for assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex, and defects in either of these molecules can lead to TRAIL resistance. Overexpression of cellular FADD-like interleukin-1b-converting enzymeinhibitory protein (cFLIP) correlates with TRAIL resistance in several types of cancer. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X L , loss of Bax or Bak function, high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and reduced release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac/Diablo) from the mitochondria to the cytosol have all been reported to result in TRAIL resistance in mitochondriadependent type II cancer cells. Finally, activation of different subunits of mitogen-activated protein kinases or nuclear factor-kappa B can lead to development of either TRAIL resistance or apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells."

text,"Poor balance in older persons contributes to a rise in fall risk and serious injury, yet no consensus has developed on which measures of postural sway can identify those at greatest risk of falling. Postural sway was measured in 161 elderly individuals (81.8y67.4), 24 of which had at least one self-reported fall in the prior six months, and compared to sway measured in 37 young adults (34.9y67.1). Center of pressure (COP) was measured during 4 minutes of quiet stance with eyes opened. In the elderly with fall history, all measures but one were worse than those taken from young adults (e.g., maximal COP velocity was 2.76 greater in fallers than young adults; p,0.05), while three measures of balance were significantly worse in fallers as compared to older persons with no recent fall history (COP Displacement, Short Term Diffusion Coefficient, and Critical Displacement). Variance of elderly subjects' COP measures from the young adult cohort were weighted to establish a balance score (''B-score'') algorithm designed to distinguish subjects with a fall history from those more sure on their feet. Relative to a young adult B-score of zero, elderly ''non-fallers'' had a B-score of 0.334, compared to 0.645 for those with a fall history (p,0.001). A weighted amalgam of postural sway elements may identify individuals at greatest risk of falling, allowing interventions to target those with greatest need of attention."
text,"Background: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae relies on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway to respond to increases in external osmolarity. The HOG pathway is rapidly activated under conditions of elevated osmolarity and regulates transcriptional and metabolic changes within the cell. Under normal growth conditions, however, a three-component phospho-relay consisting of the histidine kinase Sln1, the transfer protein Ypd1, and the response regulator Ssk1 represses HOG pathway activity by phosphorylation of Ssk1. This inhibition of the HOG pathway is essential for cellular fitness in normal osmolarity. Nevertheless, the extent to and mechanisms by which inhibition is robust to fluctuations in the concentrations of the phospho-relay components has received little attention. Results: We established that the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1 phospho-relay is robust-it is able to maintain inhibition of the HOG pathway even after significant changes in the levels of its three components. We then developed a biochemically realistic mathematical model of the phospho-relay, which suggested that robustness is due to buffering by a large excess pool of Ypd1. We confirmed experimentally that depletion of the Ypd1 pool results in inappropriate activation of the HOG pathway. Conclusions: We identified buffering by an intermediate component in excess as a novel mechanism through which a phospho-relay can achieve robustness. This buffering requires multiple components and is therefore unavailable to two-component systems, suggesting one important advantage of multi-component relays."

The first studies focused on the adoption of medical and agricultural innovations, later marketing researchers investigated the ""word-of-mouth"" diffusion process as an important mechanism by which information can reach large populations, possibly influencing public opinion, driving new product market share and brand awareness. Recently, thanks to the success of on-line social networks and microblogging platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, the phenomenon of influence exerted by users of an online social network on other users and in how it propagates in the network, has attracted the interest of computer scientists and IT specialists. One of the key problems in this area is the identification of influential users, by targeting whom certain desirable outcomes can be achieved. Here, targeting could mean giving free (or price discounted) samples of a product and the desired outcome may be to get as many customers to buy the product as possible. In this talk we take a data mining perspective and we discuss what (and how) can be learned from the available traces of past propagations. While doing this we provide a brief survey of some recent progresses in this area, as well as discuss the open problems."
text,"Abstract-Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technique that will prevail in the next generation wireless communication. Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in an OFDM system. In this paper, we formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem, which takes advantage of the sparsity of the channel impulse response and reduces the number of probing measurements, which in turn reduces the ADC speed needed for channel estimation. Specifically, we propose sending out pilots with random phases in order to ""spread out"" the sparse taps in the impulse response over the uniformly downsampled measurements at the low speed receiver ADC, so that the impulse response can still be recovered by sparse optimization. This contribution leads to high resolution channel estimation with low speed ADCs, distinguishing this paper from the existing attempts of OFDM channel estimation. We also propose a novel estimator that performs better than the commonly used 1 minimization. Specifically, it significantly reduces estimation error by combing 1 minimization with iterative support detection and limited-support least-squares. While letting the receiver ADC running at a speed as low as 1/16 of the speed of the transmitter DAC, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different measurement SNRs. The proposed system has channel estimation resolution as high as the system equipped with the high speed ADCs, and the proposed algorithm provides additional 6 dB gain for signal to noise ratio."
text,"Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of radiation protective curtains in reducing the occupational radiation exposure of medical personnel. Methods. We studied medical staff members who had assisted in 80 consecutive therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Use of radiation protective curtains mounted to the X-ray tube was determined randomly for each procedure, and radiation doses were measured with electronic pocket dosimeters placed outside the protective apron. Results. When protective curtains were not used, the mean radiation doses to endoscopists, first assistants, second assistants, and nurses were 340.9, 27.5, 45.3, and 33.1 Sv, respectively; doses decreased to 42.6, 4.2, 13.1, and 10.6 Sv, respectively, when protective curtains were used ( < 0.01). When the patient had to be restrained during ERCP ( = 8), the radiation dose to second assistants without protective curtains increased by a factor of 9.95 ( < 0.01) relative to cases in which restraint was not required. Conclusions. During ERCP, not only endoscopists, but also assistants and nurses were exposed to high doses of radiation. Radiation exposure to staff members during ERCP was reduced with the use of protective curtains."

text,"Abstract. This paper describes two ways of improving Burt and Adelson's Laplacian pyramid, a technique developed for image compression. The Laplacian pyramid is a multi-resolution image representation that captures the loss of information occurring through repeated reduction of the spatial resolution. The generation of this data structure involves the use of two complementary functions: EXPAND, which increases the size of an image by a factor of 2, and REDUCE, which performs the reverse operation. The first modification is the adjunction of a pre-filter to the initial EXPAND function in order to guarantee an image extrapolation that is an exact interpolation of the coarser resolution level. The second refinement is a REDUCE operation modified to minimize information loss. The corresponding least squares Laplacian pyramid (LSLP) is generated by adding a post-filter to the initial REDUCE function. These new functions have an efficient implementation using recursive algorithms. Preliminary experiments indicate improved performance: for a Gaussian-like kernel (a = 3), the new EXPAND function exhibits a 2 to 2.5 dB attenuation of the first level of the Laplacian pyramid, while the complete scheme (LSLP) leads to a 4.7 to 8.5 dB improvement in the two images used to test the procedure. For comparable compression ratios, the subjective image quality for the LSLP appears to be significantly better. A theoretical relationship between the present approach and the family of quadrature mirror filter image pyramids is also derived."
text,"All humans, animals, and plants are holobionts. Holobionts comprise the host and a myriad of interacting microorganisms-the microbiota. The hologenome encompasses the genome of the host plus the composite of all microbial genomes (the microbiome). In health, there is a fine-tuned and resilient equilibrium within the members of the microbiota and between them and the host. This relative stability is maintained by a high level of microbial diversity, a delicate bio-geographic distribution of microorganisms, and a sophisticated and intricate molecular crosstalk among the multiple components of the holobiont. Pathobionts are temporarily benign microbes with the potential, under modified ecosystem conditions, to become key players in disease. Pathobionts may be endogenous, living for prolonged periods of time inside or on the host, or exogenous, invading the host during opportunistic situations. In both cases, the end result is the transformation of the beneficial microbiome into a health-perturbing pathobiome. We hypothesize that probably all diseases of holobionts, acute or chronic, infectious or non-infectious, and regional or systemic, are characterized by a perturbation of the healthy microbiome into a diseased pathobiome."
text,"Noise is omnipresent in biomedical systems and signals. Conventional views assume that its presence is detrimental to systems' performance and accuracy. Hence, various analytic approaches and instrumentation have been designed to remove noise. On the contrary, recent contributions have shown that noise can play a beneficial role in biomedical systems. The results of this literature review indicate that noise is an essential part of biomedical systems and often plays a fundamental role in the performance of these systems. Furthermore, in preliminary work, noise has demonstrated therapeutic potential to alleviate the effects of various diseases."
text,"A common pitfall of many proposals on new informationcentric architectures for the Internet is the imbalance of upfront costs and immediate benefits. If properly designed and deployed, information-centric architectures can accommodate the current Internet usage which is at odds with the historical design of the Internet infrastructure. To address this concern, we focus on prospects of incremental adoption of this paradigm by introducing a peer-to-peer based transport protocol for content dissemination named Swift that exhibits properties required in an Information-Centric Network (ICN), yet can be deployed in the existing Internet infrastructure. Our design integrates components while highly prioritizing modularity and sketches a path for piecemeal adoption which we consider a critical enabler of any progress in the field."
text,"Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are commonly treated in multimodality fashion, with endovascular embolization followed by surgical extirpation being one of the most effective strategies. Modern endovascular suites enable rotational angiography, also known as cone-beam CT angiography (CBCT-A), using the full capability of modern C-arm digital angiography systems. This imaging modality offers a superior image quality to current options such as digital subtraction angiography, MRI, or CT angiography. Preoperative planning can be greatly aided by the resolution of angioarchitecture seen in CBCT-A images. Furthermore, these images can be used for intraoperative neuronavigation when integrated with widely used frameless stereotactic systems. The utility and outcome of the use of CBCT-A for preoperative planning and intraoperative localization of AVMs was evaluated. Methods A retrospective review was performed of 16 patients in which CBCT-A was performed, including radiological review and all clinical data. Results CBCT-A was successfully employed in all cases including those with (n=9) and without (n=7) rupture. Complete resection confirmed by postoperative angiography was achieved in all cases. Conclusions We present a novel application of CBCT-A in the treatment of AVMs, both for preoperative surgical planning and an intraoperative reference during neuronavigation."
text,"Linker length and composition were varied in libraries of single-chain Arc repressor, resulting in proteins with effective concentrations ranging over six orders of magnitude (10 M-10 M). Linkers of 11 residues or more were required for biological activity. Equilibrium stability varied substantially with linker length, reaching a maximum for glycine-rich linkers containing 19 residues. The effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics. By fixing the linker length at 19 residues and varying the ratio of Ala͞Gly or Ser͞Gly in a 16-residue-randomized region, the effects of linker f lexibility were examined. In these libraries, composition rather than sequence appears to determine stability. Maximum stability in the Ala͞Gly library was observed for a protein containing 11 alanines and five glycines in the randomized region of the linker. In the Ser͞Gly library, the most stable protein had seven serines and nine glycines in this region. Analysis of folding and unfolding rates suggests that alanine acts largely by accelerating folding, whereas serine acts predominantly to slow unfolding. These results demonstrate an important role for linker design in determining the stability and folding kinetics of single-chain proteins and suggest strategies for optimizing these parameters."
text,"Regression aims at estimating the conditional mean of output given input. However, regression is not informative enough if the conditional density is multimodal, heteroskedastic, and asymmetric. In such a case, estimating the conditional density itself is preferable, but conditional density estimation (CDE) is challenging in high-dimensional space. A naive approach to coping with high dimensionality is to first perform dimensionality reduction (DR) and then execute CDE. However, a two-step process does not perform well in practice because the error incurred in the first DR step can be magnified in the second CDE step. In this letter, we propose a novel single-shot procedure that performs CDE and DR simultaneously in an integrated way. Our key idea is to formulate DR as the problem of minimizing a squared-loss variant of conditional entropy, and this is solved using CDE. Thus, an additional CDE step is not needed after DR. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method through extensive experiments on various data sets, including humanoid robot transition and computer art."
text,"Breast cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide. Diabetes is an important chronic health problem associated with insulin resistance, increased insulin level, changes in growth hormones and factors, and activation of mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, leading to an increased breast cancer risk. is paper looked at the epidemiologic studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and risk of breast cancer and its effect on overall cancer-speci�c survival. e combined evidence overall supported a modest association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of breast cancer, which was found to be more prevalent among postmenopausal women. Effect of oral diabetics and insulin therapy on breast cancer risk was also evaluated. It was found that metformin and thiazolidinones tended to have a protective role. Metformin therapy trials for its use as an adjuvant for breast cancer treatment are still ongoing. Sulfonylurea and insulin therapy were found to be mildly associated with increased overall cancers. No evidence or studies evaluated the association of DPPIV inhibitors and GLP 1 agonists with breast cancer risk because of their recent introduction into the management of diabetes."

text,"The demonstrated modified spectrophotometric method makes use of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and its specific absorbance properties. The absorbance decreases when the radical is reduced by antioxidants. In contrast to other investigations, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 550 nm. This wavelength enabled the measurements of the stable free DPPH radical without interference from microalgal pigments. This approach was applied to methanolic microalgae extracts for two different DPPH concentrations. The changes in absorbance measured vs. the concentration of the methanolic extract resulted in curves with a linear decrease ending in a saturation region. Linear regression analysis of the linear part of DPPH reduction versus extract concentration enabled the determination of the microalgae's methanolic extracts antioxidative potentials which was independent to the employed DPPH concentrations. The resulting slopes showed significant differences (6 -34 µmol DPPH g -1 extract concentration) between the single different species of microalgae (Anabaena sp., Isochrysis galbana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Porphyridium purpureum, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) in their ability to reduce the DPPH radical. The independency of the signal "
text,"The vestibular system analyses angular and linear accelerations of the head that are important information for perceiving the location of one's own body in space. Vestibular stimulation and in particular galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) that allow a systematic modiWcation of vestibular signals has so far mainly been used to investigate vestibular inXuence on sensori-motor integration in eye movements and postural control. Comparatively, only a few behavioural and imaging studies have investigated how cognition of space and body may depend on vestibular processing. This study was designed to diVerentiate the inXuence of left versus right anodal GVS compared to sham stimulation on object-based versus egocentric mental transformations. While GVS was applied, subjects made leftright judgments about pictures of a plant or a human body presented at diVerent orientations in the roll plane. All subjects reported illusory sensations of body self-motion and/ or visual Weld motion during GVS. Response times in the mental transformation task were increased during right but not left anodal GVS for the more diYcult stimuli and the larger angles of rotation. Post-hoc analyses suggested that the interfering eVect of right anodal GVS was only present in subjects who reported having imagined turning themselves to solve the mental transformation task (egocentric transformation) as compared to those subjects having imagined turning the picture in space (object-based mental transformation). We suggest that this eVect relies on shared functional and cortical mechanisms in the posterior parietal cortex associated with both right anodal GVS and mental imagery."

Overall, AW has good accuracy to predict the extreme weather in the aerodrome."
text,"Individuals can simulate and pre-experience the future events. The ability to image the plausible future is termed episodic future thinking. Particularly, it is important for us to construct the detailed scenario about future event. If we couldn't simulate it in detail, we may fail to prepare what is necessary in future or deal with the unexpected event in an appropriate manner. In present study, we investigate how the level of detail specified in episodic future thinking. We supposed two possibilities specifying level of detail in future thinking: one is the retrieval process from past episodic memory and the other is the recombination process of retrieved details into coherent representation. To investigate which process is important for specifying the level of detail, we draw on the association between level of detail and temporal distance. Level of detail of imaged future event was reflected in activation pattern of concept of future temporal distances, and retrieval of detail from episodic memory was reflected in concept of past temporal distance. The results show that details were retrieved from episodic memory when participants construct the detailed image of future events. We suggest that levels of detail in future events are specified in recombination process."
text,"We reanalyzed the data from the Infrared Telescope in Space (IRTS) based on up-to-date observations of zodiacal light, integrated star light and diffuse Galactic light. We confirmed the existence of residual isotropic emission, which is slightly fainter, but at nearly the same level as previously reported. At wavelengths longer than 2 µm, our result is fairly consistent with recent observations with Japanese infrared astronomy satellite, AKARI. We performed all of our analyses using two different models of zodiacal light (Kelsall and Wright models). In both cases, we detect residual isotropic emission that is significantly brighter than the integrated light of galaxies (though slightly fainter in the case of the Wright model). Thus, we confirm the existence of excess near-infrared emission, independent of the zodiacal light model used. The spectral shape of the excess isotropic emission is similar to that of the recently observed spectrum of excess fluctuations, which suggests the excess brightness and fluctuations may arise from the same source."

text,"We generalize the Rigid-Field Hydrodynamic equations to accommodate arbitrary magnetic field topologies, resulting in a new Arbitrary Rigid-Field Hydrodynamic (ARFHD) formalism. We undertake a critical point calculation of the steady-state ARFHD equations with a CAK-type radiative acceleration and determine the effects of a dipole magnetic field on the usual CAK mass-loss rate and velocity structure. Enforcing the proper optically-thin limit for the radiative line-acceleration is found to decrease both the mass-loss and wind acceleration, while rotation boosts both properties. We define optically-thin-correction and rotation parameters to quantify these effects on the global mass-loss rate and develop scaling laws for the surface massflux as a function of surface colatitude. These scaling laws are found to agree with previous laws derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetospheres. The dipole magnetosphere velocity structure is found to differ from a global beta-velocity law, which contradicts a central assumption of the previously-developed XADM model of X-ray emission from magnetospheres."
text,"The equilibrium binding energy is an important factor in the design of materials and devices. However, it presents great computational challenges for materials built up from nanostructures. Here we investigate the binding-energy scaling law from first-principles calculations. We show that the equilibrium binding energy per atom between identical nanostructures can scale up or down with nanostructure size. From the energy scaling law, we predict finite large-size limits of binding energy per atom. We find that there are two competing factors in the determination of the binding energy: Nonadditivities of van der Waals coefficients and center-to-center distance between nanostructures. To uncode the detail, the nonadditivity of the static multipole polarizability is investigated. We find that the higher-order multipole polarizability displays ultra-strong intrinsic nonadditivity, no matter if the dipole polarizability is additive or not."

The secular gravitational torques that dynamically stabilize these disks can also produce tidal disruption events (TDEs) at very high rates in Newtonian gravity.

text,"We determine the commutation relations satisfied by the quantized electromagnetic field in the presence of macroscopic dielectrics and conductors, with arbitrary dispersive and dissipative properties. We consider in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty gap, and we show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs, including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary conditions to reproduce the correct form of the commutation relations near the surfaces of the conductors, suggests that caution should be used when these idealized boundary conditions are used in investigations of proximity phenomena originating from the quantized electromagnetic field, like the Casimir effect."
text,"The Barabási-Bianconi (BB) fitness model can be solved by a mapping between the original network growth model to an idealized bosonic gas. The well-known transition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the emergence of ""super-hubs"" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the nonextensive Kaniadakis κ-distribution. Through numerical simulation and mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the nonextensive parameter κ."
text,"Single-exposure spectra in large spectral surveys are valuable for time domain studies such as stellar variability, but there is no available method to eliminate cosmic rays for single-exposure, multi-fiber spectral images. In this paper, we describe a new method to detect and remove cosmic rays in multi-fiber spectroscopic single exposures. Through the use of two-dimensional profile fitting and a noise model that considers the position-dependent errors, we successfully detect as many as 80% of the cosmic rays and correct the cosmic ray polluted pixels to an average accuracy of 97.8%. Multiple tests and comparisons with both simulated data and real LAMOST data show that the method works properly in detection rate, false detection rate, and validity of cosmic ray correction."
text,"Exceptional points are found in the spectrum of a prototypical thermoacoustic system as the parameters of the flame transfer function are varied. At these points, two eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions coalesce. The system's sensitivity to changes in the parameters becomes infinite. Two eigenvalue branches collide at the exceptional point as the interaction index is increased. One branch originates from a purely acoustic mode, whereas the other branch originates from an intrinsic thermoacoustic mode. The existence of exceptional points in thermoacoustic systems has implications for physical understanding, computing, modeling and control."

Excluding the behavior in the NIR and UV, I discuss the other four aspects and propose a new family of extinction laws derived from VLT/FLAMES and HST/WFC3 data."

Using these data and photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have identified members with infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks and have estimated the evolutionary stages of the detected disks, which include 31 new full disks and 16 new candidate transitional, evolved, evolved transitional, and debris disks. We have also used the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog to search for new disk-bearing members of Taurus based on their red infrared colors. Through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we have confirmed 26 new members with spectral types of M1 -M7. The census of disk-bearing stars in Taurus should now be largely complete for spectral types earlier than ∼M8 (M 0.03 M )."
text,"Abstract: The semi-constrained NMSSM (scNMSSM) extends the MSSM by a singlet field, and requires unification of the soft SUSY breaking terms in the squark and slepton sectors, while it allows that in the Higgs sector to be different. We try to interpret the muon g-2 in the scNMSSM, under the constraints of 125 GeV Higgs data, B physics, searches for low and high mass resonances, searches for SUSY particles at the LHC, dark matter relic density by WMAP/Planck, and direct searches for dark matter by LUX, XENON1T, and PandaX-II. We find that under the above constraints, the scNMSSM can still (i) satisfy muon g-2 at 1σ level, with a light muon sneutrino and light chargino; (ii) predict a highly-singlet-dominated 95 GeV Higgs, with a diphoton rate as hinted at by CMS data, because of a light higgsino-like chargino and moderate λ; (iii) get low fine tuning from the GUT scale with small µ eff , M0, M 1/2 , andA0, with a lighter stop mass which can be as low as about 500 GeV, which can be further checked in future studies with search results from the 13 TeV LHC; (iv) have the lightest neutralino be singlino-dominated or higgsino-dominated, while the bino and wino are heavier because of high gluino bounds at the LHC and universal gaugino conditions at the GUT scale; (v) satisfy all the above constraints, although it is not easy for the lightest neutralino, as the only dark matter candidate, to get enough relic density. Several ways to increase relic density are discussed."
text,"We investigate the approximate quantum state sharing protocol based on random unitary channels, which is secure against any exterior or interior attackers in principle. Although the protocol leaks small information for a security parameter ε, the scheme still preserves its information-theoretic secrecy, and reduces some pre-shared classical secret keys for a private quantum channel between a sender and two receivers. The approximate private quantum channels constructed via random unitary channels play a crucial role in the proposed quantum state sharing protocol."
text,"In this research, three different hormones and five different hormone dosages were applied on cuttings were taken from Anatolian sage plants (Salvia fruticosa Mill.) before flowering period. NAA, IBA (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 ppm) and IAA hormones (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 ppm) were prepared by dissolving in distilled water. Stem cuttings were kept in hormone solution for 24 hours and they were planted in perlit medium under greenhouse conditions. After a month, the number of rooted stem cutting, the number of root per stem cuttings, root length and root weight were determined on stem cuttings. Rooting was observed in all of the cuttings for both samples to which hormone was applied and to which hormone was not applied. According to the result of the variance analysis, the effects of the hormones and hormone doses on the examined characters were found significant as statistically. According to the results obtained, IAA application increased root number considerably. While high hormone dose applications caused the notable increase in root weight and root number in all of three hormones, low hormone applications did not affect root length."
